	The pdf contains the homework task.
	Hw1.zip  		- homework archive;
	checker.zip 	- checker archive;
	aegraph.cpp		- the main logic of the program, which gets a logical operation graph and evaluates it, reducing an
	input graph as much as possible discarding the redundant information and operatinos (such as 'x OR 1' because the
