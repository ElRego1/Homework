	Hw3.zip			- homework archive;
	checker.zip		- checker archive;
	main.c			- the main logic of the program, where we had to implement a RPG like game where elves were
fighting on a map, with terrain ellevation, and where could find different items that boost their attack stats
and sometimes the glacier would melt and some elves would sink and lose.
	functii.h		- a header file with a helper function to read the input in a cleant way;
	functii.c		- the implementation of the functiona stated in the header file;
	spiridusi.h		- a header file with the definitions of functions (the moving on the map, the normal attacks,
the area of effect attack etc.) that make the logic of the game;
	spiridusi.c		- the implementation of the funcitons in the header file.
